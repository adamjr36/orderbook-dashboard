# Orderbook Visualization tool

Exactly what it sounds like. Available at [orderbook.adamjackrubinstein.com](orderbook.adamjackrubinstein.com) !

## Issues / Future improvements
1. Add a way to save the orderbook to a file to reupload later
2. Save state on page reload
3. Graphs by userId for PNL, positions over time
4. Multiple symbols?
