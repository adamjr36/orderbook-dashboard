# Orderbook Visualization tool

Exactly what it sounds like. Available at [orderbook.adamjackrubinstein.com](orderbook.adamjackrubinstein.com) ! Created supafast with Trae.

## Issues / Future improvements
1. Graphs don't look great when there are only a couple orders
2. Add a way to save the orderbook to a file to reupload later
3. Save state on page reload
4. Graphs by userId for PNL, positions over time
5. Multiple symbols?
